	Hello Internet
	<br>
	<br>
	My name is Juan Pablo Meza, I am 20 years old, I am a shift leader at one of the restaurants of the famous chicago hot dog chain "Portillo's". I've been working there for 4 years and I love it. I love the people, I love the food, and I love just making customers happy whenevr I give them their food. I like to make sure I give them the 'Portillo's Experience'.

	<br>
	I am currently in my 3rd year at College of DuPage. I took the fall semester off to help with bills around the house and to deal with some family issues. I plan on majoring as a Computer Engineer in the software development area. After College of DuPage I plan on going to Lewis University or Benedictine with the 3+1 program.
