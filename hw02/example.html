	<h4>What I do</h4>
	<p>I work at The Portillo's and Barnelli's Pasta Bowl on Route 59 in Naperville Illinois. I've been working there for 4 years. I am a Crew Chief(Shift Leader) and I make sure I direct all my employees to the right spots that will help us have a smooth and fun shift.</p>
<p>The first Portillo's hot dog stand known as "The Dog House" opens in 1963 on North Avenue in Villa Park. Owner and founder Dick Portillo invests $1,100 into a 6' x 12' trailer without a bathroom or running water. To get the water he needs, he runs 250 feet of garden hose from a nearby building into the trailer.</p>
<p>In 2017, We expand to Minnesota, opening our 50th location in Woodbury, a suburb of St. Paul. We also open our second Wisconsin location in Greenfield, and added two locations south of Chicago in Champaign, IL, near University of Illinois and Normal, IL, near Illinois State University. We also launched delivery in November, making Portillo's available on demand at most locations nationwide.</p>
